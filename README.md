general idea:
to do lists are an organic informal form of writing that represents what our priorities are at any given point. The reflect back at us myriad things from something as trivial as shopping list to something as important as long term goals or hopes and dreams. At the same time, I’ve found that writing my to do list is more of an aspiration than an actual prediction for what I’ll get done over any period of time. Things pile up and crowd until I’m forced to deal with them urgently. Sometimes the list is satisfyingly sparse after lots of things get completed that day. Sometimes, and this even less frequently, I get the satisfaction of completing a longer-term item on my to do list be it a goal or project (personal or otherwise). One thing that seems to be true, at least for myself, is that my to do list is never fully checked off. At the end of the day, there’s always something on the list, and each day at least one thing is usually added. I don’t want to moralize this and cast myself as Sisyphus or take some capitalist critiquing stance against to do lists. In fact, I find its constant presence comforting, a kind of stabilizing presence in my life.

_____________________________________________
an iteration is as long as it takes to write the number of short term items for a given day + a couple seconds

Initially:
- the to do list appears already populated (we’ve entered the infinite cycle)
	how do I want it to appear? fade in, just appear, line by line?
- the date is initialized to the current date
- then begins the first iteration

every iteration of the to-do list:
- 1 - today.length short term things are completed and ‘erased’
- 0 - 1 longterm_projects are completed (very low probability to model time passing) and ‘erased’
- the date is set to date.next()
- 1-4 short term things are written onto the to do list
- 0-1 longterm_projects or longterm_goals is added to the to do lists with extremely low probability

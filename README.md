general idea:
to do lists are an organic, informal form of writing that represents what our priorities are at any given point. I’ve found that writing my to do list is more of an aspiration than an actual prediction for what I’ll get done over any period of time. Things pile up until I’m forced to deal with them urgently. Sometimes the list is satisfyingly sparse after lots of things get completed that day. Sometimes, and this even less frequently, I get the satisfaction of completing a longer-term item on my to do list be it a goal or project. One thing that seems to be true is that my to do list is never fully checked off, never empty. At the end of the day, there’s always something on the list, and each day at least one thing is usually added.
